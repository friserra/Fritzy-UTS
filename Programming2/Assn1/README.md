# Programming 2 (48024) - Spring Semester 2023 - Assignment 1

## What is this assignment about?
Students were asked to code a travel agency's management system using the what we've learnt (Object-Oriented Design, Standard Patterns, & Lists). The whole system runs in the command-line.

It had to include sections for managing destinations and flights of the agency, as well as planning a client's travel itinerary.

## What challenges did I face?

### I am a bit rusty...
This was the first real coding I had done in a while (I transferred institutions and had to catch up on core subjects at UTS) so I had to re-establish my basics first of all. Most of the weekly assignments did help with that though, so it wasn't too rough.

### Yikes, a new programming language!
Java was also a new programming language. I was very overwhelmed with these new concepts like constructors, classes and the whatnot. I only knew how to do JavaScript and very basic C. Again, the weekly assignments also helped with this.

## What is the success criteria of this assignment?
Marks were based on functionality of each function, marks adding up to 100:
| Function | Marks |
| -------- | ----- |
| Main Menu | 5 |
| Login | 5 |
| Destinations Menu | 5 |
| View Destinations | 5 |
| View Destinations Filtered | 5 |
| Add Destination | 5 |
| Remove Destination | 5 |
| Flights Menu | 5 |
| View Flights | 5 |
| View Flights Filtered | 5 |
| Add Flight | 5 |
| Remove Flight | 5 |
| Trip (Itinerary) Menu | 5 |
| Add/Remove Destinations from Trip | 15 |
| Add Connecting Flights | 20 |

I got 100% for this assignment :D
